# CreditGuard AI: Payment Delay Prediction

A machine learning solution to predict credit card payment delays at FinanKu financial institution.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project develops predictive models to identify customers at risk of credit card payment delays, achieving:
- **Accuracy: 68.62%**
- **Recall: 60.56%**
- Successfully meeting the business target of 60% for both metrics

## 🔍 Models Implemented

- **Gradient Boosting (Best performer)**
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

## 📈 Key Findings

1. **Gradient Boosting** provided the best balance between accuracy and recall
2. Clear trade-off observed between accuracy and recall across models
3. Hyperparameter tuning significantly impacted model performance
